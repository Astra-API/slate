<p>Welcome to the Astra API documentation for traders and developers. Astra eliminates the often complex, unpredictable, and unstable behavior of communciating with cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>Astra provides fast reliable connections to several exchanges to users.</p>

<!-- Astra distills a myriad of different exchange specific data packets into Astra's unified data formats, designed to swiftly integrate with developers' trading systems. -->

<p>Users leverage Astra by forwarding unified data formats (JSON&#39;s) containing exchange and market specific requests to the API which Astra transform into exchange compatible messages, speedily returning useful data.</p>

<p>The API is separated into three categories: Public HTTP API, Private HTTP API, and Websockets API. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private HTTP API requests require authentication and enable those users to place orders and view user sepcific data.</p></li>
<li><p>Public HTTP and Websockets API&#39;s are both public, accessible to all users.</p></li>
</ul>
